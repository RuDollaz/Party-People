   <h1>You're finally in. Everyone from your school is at the party and the music is blasting through your brain and is shaking the ground with every step you take. There's two main parts of the party. The 1st floor is mostly guys and girls trying to dance and drink "juice." The 2nd floor is mostly girls and crazy partiers. Where do you want to go?</h1>
